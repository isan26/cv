### About me

Full stack developer with 10+ years of experience, passionate for team work, software architecture, S.O.L.I.D principles, good coding practices and patterns.
I like to think twice and code once, with a focus on the problem and the people involved rather than an specific tech stack.
It’s very important for me to develop new skills and keep pushing my limits.
